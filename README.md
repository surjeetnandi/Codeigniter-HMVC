# What is CodeIgniter

**CodeIgniter** is an Application Development **MVC** Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

# What is MVC 

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the **model**, the **view**, and the **controller**. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. **MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects**.


# What is HMVC

**HMVC** stands for **Hierarchical Model View Controller** application design pattern which makes your application modular. It give you chance to separate the controller, model and view in to some module so you can maintenance or improve the application easily.

# Server Requirements

**PHP version 5.6 +** recommended.

It should work on 5.6 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
